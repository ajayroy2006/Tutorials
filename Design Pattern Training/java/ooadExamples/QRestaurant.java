/* 
 * Food To Go Inc. is a company that delivers food orders from 
 * restaurants to customers' homes and offices. 
 * The founders of "Food to Go" have decided to build a J2EE-based 
 * application to run their business. This application supports the 
 * following kinds of users:
 *  	> Customers - Place orders and check order status
 *  	> Customer service reps - Handle phone enquiries from 
 *  					customers about their orders
 *  	> Restaurants - Maintain menus and prepare the orders 
 *  	> Dispatchers - Assign drivers to orders 
 *  	> Drivers - Pick up orders from restaurants and deliver them
 *
 * The requirements
 * After a lot of discussion, they jointly decide on the following 
 * scenario to describe how an order flows through the system. 
 * The sequence of events is as follows:
 * 		1 The customer places the order via the website.
 * 		2 The system sends the order (by fax or email) to the restaurant.
 * 		3 The restaurant acknowledges receipt of the order.
 * 		4 A dispatcher assigns a driver to the order.
 * 		5 The system sends a notification to the assigned driver.
 * 		6 The driver views the assigned order on a cell phone.
 * 		7 The driver picks up the order from the restaurant and 
 * 			notifies the system that the order has been picked up.
 * 		8 The driver delivers the order to the customer and 
 * 			notifies the system that the order has been delivered.
 *
 * 	In the first iteration, following use cases will be done:
 * 		> Place Order - Describes how a customer places an order
 * 		> View Orders - Describes how a customer service 
 * 					representative can view orders
 * 		> Send Orders to Restaurant - Describes how the system sends 
 * 					orders to restaurants
 * 		> Acknowledge Order - Describes how a restaurant can 
 * 					acknowledge receipt of an order
 * 		> Modify Order - Describes how a customer service 
 * 					representative can modify an order
 *
 *
 * 	Identify the Business logic classes needed in the first
 * 	iteration. Draw the class diagram.
 *  For every class mention its role e.g. Entity, Value,
 *  Service, Factory or Repository.
